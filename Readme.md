### Explanation:

- **Preview of Generated Invoice Section:** Added a new section titled "Preview of Generated Invoice" where the image of the invoice (`invoice.png`) is displayed using Markdown image syntax (`![Generated Invoice](path/to/invoice.png)`).
- **Path to Image:** Replace `path/to/invoice.png` with the actual path where your invoice image (`invoice.png`) is located relative to your README file.

By following these steps, users can visually preview the generated invoice directly within your README, providing them with a quick glimpse of the output your invoice generator produces. Adjust the image path and filename as per your project's directory structure and naming conventions.
